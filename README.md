# Number Tools

A simple Python application that reverses integers and checks if they are palindromes. Includes both CLI and Tkinter GUI interfaces.

## Features

- **Reverse Number**: Takes an integer and returns its reversed value
- **Palindrome Check**: Determines if a number is a palindrome
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line based interaction
- **Tkinter GUI**: User-friendly graphical interface

## Usage

### CLI Version
```bash
python reverse_num.py
```
Enter a number when prompted to see:
- The reversed number
- Whether it's a palindrome

### GUI Version
```bash
python number_tools_gui.py
```
A graphical window will open where you can:
- Enter a number in the input field
- Click "Process" or press Enter to get results
- Click "Clear" to reset the form

## Examples

- Input: `121` → Reversed: `121` → Is Palindrome: **Yes**
- Input: `123` → Reversed: `321` → Is Palindrome: **No**
- Input: `12321` → Reversed: `12321` → Is Palindrome: **Yes**
